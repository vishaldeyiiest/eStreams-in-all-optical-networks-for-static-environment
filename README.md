## Abstract
- Since a single fiber carries a huge amount of data in Optical WDM Networks,
  designing schemes to prevent disruption of user traffic and recovery techniques from failures is
  an important area of research. In this paper we address the problem of protecting all-optical
  WDM mesh networks from single link failure. We propose an offline protection scheme that is
  not only cost-efficient in terms of network resource consumption but can also provide quick
  recovery from a link failure. In our scheme, backup paths are combined to reduce cost of
  protection and to facilitate fast recovery from a failure. We address a critical issue related to
  selection of backup paths to be combined, which was not addressed earlier. Instead of choosing
  backup paths for connection requests arbitrary as done in an existing scheme, our scheme is
  designed to select backup paths in a way that they are suitable for combination and can maximize
  resource saving as well. We first provide an Integer Linear Program for the problem, and then
  propose a heuristic eStreams that can provide near optimal solution in polynomial time.
  Performance comparisons show that our approach is definitely an improvement.
## Results
- Results computed by heuristics in polynomial time are very close to optimal. 

## Future Work
- Paper on this work titled "An Offline Scheme for Reducing Cost of Protection in All-Optical
  WDM Mesh Networks with Fast Recovery" is under peer review in International Journal of Parallel, 
  Emergent and Distributed Systems, Taylor and Francis, UK.
